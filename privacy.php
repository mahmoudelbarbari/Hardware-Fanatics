		Additionally, Pinterest also states that it collects user location data from mobile devices, and if someone
		makes a
		purchase on Pinterest, payment and contact information - including an address and phone number - will be
		collected. If
		users buy products or services for others, Pinterest gathers their contact information and shipping details,
		too.

		Users may also give Pinterest permission to access information that is shared with other websites like Facebook
		and
		Twitter by linking their Pinterest account with them. This information would also include information about
		their
		friends and followers. The account settings have information about how much access Pinterest has to their users'
		data.

		In sum, a Privacy Policy is where you let your users know all about how you make sure their privacy is respected
		by your
		business practices.

		Why you Need a Privacy Policy

		Privacy is not a new concept. Humans have always desired privacy in their social as well as private lives. But
		the idea
		of privacy as a human right is a relatively modern phenomenon.

		Around the world, laws and regulations have been developed for the protection of data related to government,
		education,
		health, children, consumers, financial institutions, etc.

		This data is critical to the person it belongs to. Data privacy and security binds individuals and industries
		together
		and runs complex systems in our society. From credit card numbers and social security numbers to email addresses
		and
		phone numbers, our sensitive, personally identifiable information is important. This sort of information in
		unreliable
		hands can potentially have far-reaching consequences.

		Companies or websites that handle customer information are required to publish their Privacy Policies on their
		business
		websites. If you own a website, web app, mobile app or desktop app that collects or processes user data, you
		most
		certainly will have to post a Privacy Policy on your website (or give in-app access to the full Privacy Policy
		agreement).

		There are several reasons for a website to post its Privacy Policy agreement on its website.

		Here are some of the main reasons:

		Required by the law
		Required by third party services
		Increases Transparency
		Let's take a look at each of these reasons in more depth.

		A Privacy Policy is Required by the Law

		For individuals to feel comfortable sharing their personal information on the internet, there should be some
		sort of
		legal responsibility on businesses to protect that data and keep the users informed about the status and health
		of their
		information.

		Countries around the world have realized the need to protect their citizens' data and privacy. Businesses and
		websites
		that collect and/or process customer information are required to publish and abide by a Privacy Policy
		agreement.

		A majority of countries have already enacted laws to protect their users' data security and privacy. These laws
		require
		businesses to obtain explicit consent from users whose data they will store or process.
		For a business or a website that collects and processes user information in a certain region or country, it is
		very
		important to have complete knowledge of the data and privacy protection laws enforced in that region and the
		region your
		customers and end users are in. Non-compliance with these laws can result in hefty fines or even prosecution
		against the
		violator.

		In some cases, businesses have to follow laws specific to states or regulations specific to industries.
		General Motors informs its California users of their rights through its Privacy Policy as required by CalOPPA.

		If your website/app reaches users around the world, regardless of where you're located or headquartered, you'll
		need to
		make sure you follow privacy laws in all applicable countries you reach.

		While data protection and privacy laws differ from region to region, a Privacy Policy must comprehensively
		inform its
		users about how their data will be used.

		For example, the GDPR is currently the most robust privacy legislation in the world and one of its main
		requirements for
		any business that falls under its jurisdiction is to have a GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy that contains some
		very
		specific information and is written in an easy-to-understand way.

		Whether your website is a self-help blog or a game hosted at Google Play, it is your responsibility to give your
		end
		users complete information about how any associated third-parties will collect and process their data and (if
		possible)
		to what purpose.

		A Privacy Policy is Required by Third Party Services

		Apart from governing laws, some websites like Apple, Amazon, and Google require website and app owners to post a
		Privacy
		Policy agreement if they use any of their services.

		Many websites and apps use in-page/in-app advertising by third parties to generate revenue. As these ads also
		collect
		user data, third parties require the websites or apps to ask their users' permission for sharing their personal
		data.

		For example, if you're using Google Analytics on your website, the Google Analytics Terms of Service requires
		that you
		post a Privacy Policy agreement. In addition to this, you must also disclose that you're using Google Analytics
		and some
		information about how it collects and processes data:Third party vendors like Google, Facebook, and Amazon
		require their
		users (website and app owners) to explicitly inform their users if they're using advertising features, cookies,
		or
		tracking services on their websites/apps in order to deliver better user experiences based on prior browsing
		behavior.

		Here's how Ookla - a fixed broadband and mobile network testing company - informs its users in its Privacy
		Policy
		agreement that it uses cookies, log files, flash cookies, local storage, etc., in its website-based and mobile
		applications in order to (1) improve performance, (2) to better understand how Ookla's software functions, and
		(3) to
		give the user a personalized experience.
